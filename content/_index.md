Hiii, I'm Hiyori \(@^0^@)/  welcome to *my digital garden* where I write stuff such as:
- me learning stuff.
- my projects progress.
- my dev enviroment.
- software I use.
- some tutorials I use as self-reminders.
- stuff to explore / experiment with later.
- general thoughts?

I'm usually studying mathematics, C++, Python and embedded systems.
